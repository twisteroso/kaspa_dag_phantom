# Kaspa DAG Phantom ◈◈◈

Kaspa doesn't have blocks.  
It has a living mesh of time.

Most transactions crawl through it.

Then, once in a blue moon,  
something **massive** moves so fast and so dense  
that the entire DAG ripples like water.

This script doesn't watch Kaspa.

It waits for the moment  
the network itself flinches.

When a transaction carries >100k KAS  
and weighs more than a million "mass units" —  
that's not a whale.

That's a phantom made of pure velocity  
passing through a lattice of parallel universes.

Kaspa didn't process it.  
Kaspa **became** it for 400 milliseconds.

```bash
python kaspa_dag_phantom.py
